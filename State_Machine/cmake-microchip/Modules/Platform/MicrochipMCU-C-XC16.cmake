# Unfortunately the normal CMake compiler detection process doesn't work
# with XC16. It functions by compiling a file which uses preprocessor
# conditionals to determine the compiler type and version and puts that
# information in string literals, then running `strings` on the output
# file and parsing out the detected values. That fails for XC16 because
# string literals are not packed contiguously and therefore `strings`
# can't find them.
#
# In intermediate object files, XC16 handles character literals as
# 16-bit integers and string literals as arrays of character literals.
# The strings therefore appear in the file with a zero byte after each
# character. See the "MPLAB XC16 C Compiler User's Guide" (DS50002071E)
# section 8.9 "Literal Constant Types and Formats".
#
# In the final executable file that issue is resolved as by that point
# the compiler has optimized the 16-bit character literals down to 8-bit
# values. `strings` still doesn't work, however. Program memory on the
# 16-bit MCUs uses 24-bit words but is addressed on 16-bit boundaries.
# Each program word therefore has an extra addressable byte which
# doesn't actually exist. In the executable file that byte is included
# and always zero, so string literals are written as groups of three
# characters separated by zero bytes.
#
#
# We therefore have to implement compiler version detection ourselves.
# Fortunately that's quite easy as we know we're dealing with XC16 and
# it has a `--version` switch that produces both the GCC anc XC16
# version numbers. We still allow CMake's feature detection and test
# routines to run as they still find some useful information.
